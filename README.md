Predicting local list prices of red & white wines on the Vivino marketplace

This project was completed during the IBM-SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme-Company Training.

Problem Statement: Wine merchants in Singapore offer similar wines and are uncertain in pricing them appropriately for the local market:
Goal: To help local wine merchants select and price quality wines, in order to diversify their product mix and expand their revenue in the local market.

This project was carried out using IBM's Enterprise Design Thinking (EDT) method.

In Descriptive analytics, a few stages were involved such as web scraping, text manipulation, data exploration and cleansing as well as data visualization. We used selenium, chromium, GNU (pronounced as ‘nu’) bash shell, python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn along with IBM watson!

For Diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, we used python, IBM Watson as well as AutoAI.

When we fitted our data into AutoAI, the top features that influenced price were wine rating as well as wine age.

Nonetheless, our results reflected underfitting as we used RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to measure how far our predictions were off the original price. There is a need to perhaps increase sample size, adjust model parameters and complexity, or engineer new features
